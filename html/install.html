                <h2>Yo! What's good!</h2>
                Thanks for installing BetterKick! Other one of ktg5's cool extensions.
                <br>
                <br>
                Since Kick's site has functions & issues that they don't seem like they
                want to fix, I've come in to help this site to be a little better.
                <br>
                <br>
                If you possibly step upon an issue such as something with the styling,
                slower performance, something conflicting with another extension, or
                whatever you think seems off,
                <a href='https://github.com/ktg5/BetterKick/issues'>
                feel free to report them on the GitHub page!</a>
                <br>
                <br>
                Thanks and have the most awesome of awesome days!
